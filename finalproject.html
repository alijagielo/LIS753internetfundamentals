Welcome to my site for her favorite cafe picks! Tired of the popular Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts flavors? For fans of coffee and always looking to try new brands, I will be your go-to to determine if a brand is worth the buy or to keep on the store shelves.

        <h2>Why Trust Ali?</h2>
        <p>
          Love of coffee has been a family tradition in my house. With a family of morning people, coffee in the morning is essential. Slow mornings are where we can all sit and chat. The value of this bond was made clear to me when my grandparents would come visit; my mother and grandma would wake up before everyone at six in the morning to have coffee and talk and enjoy the quiet morning. Seeing this tradition sparked a love for mornings and truly valuing how a good cup of coffee can kick-start a great day.

I’ve consumed coffee for over 5 years and love to try a new brew when I get the chance. I never miss an opportunity to try a new brand, especially when it comes recommended from close family and friends!

        <h3>Coffee Always In My Cabinet</h3>
        <p>
          With the holidays coming up, my friends always give me bags of Chamberlain coffee. The packaging is aesthetically pleasing and the beans provide just as pleasing tastes. Because it’s a favorite gift for me, December-February in my cabinet is ALWAYS stocked with Chamberlain coffee! Find the link above to my favorite flavor.
